<h1>Caffeine</h1>

<p class="para1">Caffeine amounts typically range from 16 mg to 160 mg.
   Coffee typically has about 135 mg of caffeine, whereas an energy drink may have up to 160 mg.
   Various types of tea typically have between 15 mg and 40 mg of caffeine. 
   If you are pounding energy drinks on a daily basis, your body has likely become accustomed to high levels of caffeine.   
</p>
<p class="para2">No drug is used more widely in the world than caffeine. 
    The omnipresence of caffeine, however, sometimes makes people forget that it is a powerful stimulant.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to keeping you alert and energized, caffeine has many suggested health benefits, but consuming too much has its costs. 
    Too much caffeine can lead to increased anxiety or complicate an existing anxiety disorder by increasing symptoms.
</p>

<h1>Does Caffeine Cause Anxiety?</h1>

<p class="para3">
    Caffeine, especially in higher than recommended doses, may make anxiety symptoms worse. 
    This is especially true of people with a panic disorder. 
    A recent meta-analysis found that high doses of caffeine (around five cups of coffee) 
    is associated with panic attacks in a large proportion of people with panic disorder.
</p>

<p class="para4">
    There may be a biochemical explanation for why caffeine negatively affects anxiety states. Because caffeine indirectly triggers the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin into the bloodstream, blood pressure rises. People then feel their heart racing, which can lead to or worsen feelings of anxiety.
</p>

<p class="para5">
    Caffeine can also negatively affect sleep. Research has shown that regular consumption of caffeine is connected to sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness. This likely sets up a vicious cycle: caffeine leads to poor sleep, followed by daytime sleepiness, and then you reach for more caffeine to combat the sleepiness.

<h1>Good Effects of Caffeine</h1>
<ol>
    <li>In Japan, researchers have shown that caffeine increases memory. Also, a newer study out of Johns Hopkins University showed that a 200 mg caffeine pill helped boost memory consolidation.</li>
    <li>Caffeine mixed with carbs replenishes muscle glycogen concentrations faster after exercise.</li>
    <li>Caffeine before exercise increases fat burn. “Compared to the placebo, caffeine increased fat oxidation by 10.7% in the morning and 29% in the afternoon. Caffeine also increased exercise intensity by 11% in the morning and 13% in the afternoon. The maximum oxygen uptake was also higher in the afternoon“, Reported WebMd about a study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. </li>
    <li>Caffeine detoxes the liver and cleanses the colon when taken as a caffeine enema.</li>
    <li>Caffeine helps keep you alert while driving during periods of sleep restriction. Here’s the research. However, research has also shown that truck drivers that use the most caffeine have more accidents. Caffeine isn’t a long-term solution for lack of sleep.</li>

<h1>Bad Effects of Caffeine</h1>
<ul>
    <li>More than 4 cups of coffee linked to an early death. A Mayo Clinic partnered study found that men who drank more than four 8 fl oz cups of coffee had a 21% increase in all-cause mortality. However, those that reported that they consumed excessive amounts of caffeine were also likely to smoke and have poor fitness. Dr. Nancy Snyderman from NBC said there were a few discrepancies with the study, but stresses that moderation is still key. See Her Interview Here. Another study showed that those who consume 6+ coffees per day have a greater risk of developing heart disease. Another study concluded that those that consume more than 6 cups of coffee daily are prone to poor health and possibly an earlier death and poor quality of life due to those diseases.</li>
    <li>Caffeine consumption may raise blood pressure. Especially in those already suffering from hypertension and those who don’t normally consume caffeine. People with hypertension were given 250 mg of caffeine (about 2 coffees) and the data revealed that their blood pressure was elevated for about 2-3 hours after the caffeine. Src. A second study performed by The Mayo Clinic found similar results from a 160 mg dose. All participants experienced a marked rise in blood pressure and it was the most pronounced in those that didn’t normally consume caffeine.</li>
    <li>Increased risk of heart attacks among young adults. A study conducted by Dr. Lucio Mos found that young adults who were diagnosed with mild hypertension had 4 times the risk of having a heart attack if they consumed the amount of caffeine equivalent to 4 cups of coffee.  More moderate consumption showed 3 times the risk.</li>
    <li>Caffeine linked to gout attacks. This study showed that people who binge on caffeinated beverages increase their risk for a gout flare-up.</li>
    <li>Breast tissue cysts in women. One study showed that “Women who consumed 31–250 mg of caffeine/day had a 1.5-fold increase in the odds of developing fibrocystic breast disease and women who drank over 500 mg/day had a 2.3-fold increase in the odds of developing cysts.</li>

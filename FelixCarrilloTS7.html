<h1>Caffeine</h1>

<p class="para1">Caffeine amounts typically range from 16 mg to 160 mg.
   Coffee typically has about 135 mg of caffeine, whereas an energy drink may have up to 160 mg.
   Various types of tea typically have between 15 mg and 40 mg of caffeine. 
   If you are pounding energy drinks on a daily basis, your body has likely become accustomed to high levels of caffeine.   
</p>
<p class="para2">No drug is used more widely in the world than caffeine. 
    The omnipresence of caffeine, however, sometimes makes people forget that it is a powerful stimulant.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to keeping you alert and energized, caffeine has many suggested health benefits, but consuming too much has its costs. 
    Too much caffeine can lead to increased anxiety or complicate an existing anxiety disorder by increasing symptoms.

<h1>Does Caffeine Cause Anxiety?</h1>

<p class="para3">
    Caffeine, especially in higher than recommended doses, may make anxiety symptoms worse. 
    This is especially true of people with a panic disorder. 
    A recent meta-analysis found that high doses of caffeine (around five cups of coffee) 
    is associated with panic attacks in a large proportion of people with panic disorder.
</p>

<p class="para4">
    There may be a biochemical explanation for why caffeine negatively affects anxiety states. Because caffeine indirectly triggers the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin into the bloodstream, blood pressure rises. People then feel their heart racing, which can lead to or worsen feelings of anxiety.
</p>

<p class="para5">
    Caffeine can also negatively affect sleep. Research has shown that regular consumption of caffeine is connected to sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness. This likely sets up a vicious cycle: caffeine leads to poor sleep, followed by daytime sleepiness, and then you reach for more caffeine to combat the sleepiness.
